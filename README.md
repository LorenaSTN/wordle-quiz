## 📋 Features

After each guess, the letters change color to give you clues:

- ⚪ Gray: The letter is not in the word.

- 🟠 Orange: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

- 🟢 Green: The letter is in the word and in the correct position.

The goal is to guess the word before running out of attempts.
